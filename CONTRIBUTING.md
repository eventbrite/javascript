# Contributing

If you would like to make changes to this repo, please:

1. Make a GitHub Pull Request with the suggested change
2. Post the Pull Request in the Slack channel: #Frontend
3. Wait a day or two (at least 24 hours) for feedback
4. Ping the #Frontend channel again
5. If you have at least a few approvals, and no one is hard disapproving of your PR, merge it
6. If we can't come to an agreement, you may choose to either:
    - Close the pull request
    - Create a meeting to discuss the change (if it's going to take a lot of time)
    - Bring the change up in the next Frontend Guild meeting (if it won't take too much time)
